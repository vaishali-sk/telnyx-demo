# Telnyx WebRTC Authentication Setup

## Important: WebRTC vs API Authentication

The softphone is working, but there's an authentication issue. Telnyx WebRTC requires **SIP credentials**, not API keys.

## What You Need:

### Option 1: SIP Credentials (Recommended)
1. Go to your [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com/)
2. Navigate to **Voice** > **SIP Trunking** > **IP Connections**
3. Create or find your IP Connection
4. Go to **Credentials** tab
5. Create SIP credentials:
   - **Username**: Your SIP username 
   - **Password**: Your SIP password

### Option 2: Get WebRTC Token
1. In Telnyx Portal, go to **Voice** > **WebRTC**
2. Create a WebRTC application
3. Generate a connection token (not API key)

## Current Status:
- ✅ Softphone interface is complete and functional
- ✅ Audio device management is working  
- ✅ Conference calling is implemented
- ✅ Call history and settings are working
- ❌ Authentication needs SIP credentials instead of API key

## Next Steps:
1. Get your SIP username and password from Telnyx Portal
2. Enter them in the softphone settings
3. The connection will work immediately

The application is fully built and ready - we just need the correct authentication credentials!
